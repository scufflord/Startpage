# Startpage — Dynamic Font Colors

Minimal personal startpage with theme support, bookmarks, and configurable background.

Quick start

- Open `startpage.html` in your browser (or serve the folder with a simple static server).
- Customize themes via the dropdown or the custom theme editor in the Config modal.
- Bookmarks are editable in the Config modal and persisted to `localStorage`.

What I changed for open-source friendliness

- Separated inline CSS into `css/styles.css` and JS into `js/script.js`.
- Added basic accessibility hooks and safer element access in JS.
- Included `LICENSE` (MIT) and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for community contributions.
